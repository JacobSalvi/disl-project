# Extra Information

## In exercise #2 
The assignment said: "performed by threads of type ex2.MyThread", but after decompiling 
the code we noticed the name was ex2.MainThread.

## In exercise #5
The function takes as input an int "n" and return an array containing
the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence.

## In exercise #7
For this exercise we made two versions, one using a CustomContext to get the
information of the type of the new created array from the bytes following the
"anewarray" instruction. The other way is commented and get the type from
the array object after it has been created.

Additionally, we also implemented the bonus using the same custom context.
